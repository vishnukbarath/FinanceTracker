bash
npx expo start -c
Core Concepts
Transactions
Each transaction has:

id: string

type: 'income' | 'expense'

amount: number

category: string (e.g., Food, Travel)

description: string

date: string (ISO or formatted)

notes?: optional string

Transactions are managed by TransactionContext and persisted in AsyncStorage under the key transactions.

Budgets
Each budget has:

id: string

category: string (expense category)

amount: number (budget limit)

period: 'weekly' | 'monthly'

spent: number (computed based on transactions)

Budgets are managed by BudgetContext and stored under the key budgets.
The app recalculates spent based on current transactions in the selected time window.

Navigation
Root Stack

(tabs) – main app with bottom tabs

add – Add transaction (modal)

edit – Edit transaction (modal)

Bottom Tabs

Home – summary, recent transactions, budget alerts

Transactions – full history with filters and edit/delete

Budget – create/manage budgets with progress bars

More – app info and “Clear All Data”

Data Persistence
The app uses AsyncStorage to save:

transactions – array of Transaction objects

budgets – array of Budget objects

Data is loaded on app start inside each context’s useEffect.
Contexts expose helper functions like getTotalIncome, getTotalExpenses, and calculateSpent.

Customization Ideas
Add charts (e.g., category-wise expense pie chart)

Add authentication and sync with backend

Export data to CSV

Add dark mode

Support multiple currencies and localization

Notes
This app is designed as an offline-first personal tracker.

All logic is in contexts and screens; UI/components can be refactored further into reusable components as the project grows.
